	<p3>Media Design School</p3><br>
	<p3>2013</p3><br>
	<p>To do this course, students had to have an "ability to demonstrate a unique and insightful view of the world", and "proof of determination, problem solving, lateral thought, motivation
and most importantly, creativity."

I learnt many useful skills, including presenting ideas, copywriting, visual communication and techniques for generating ideas, while working on a range of projects that included
		competitions and client briefs.</p><br>

	<strong>Achievements</strong><br><br>
	I performed well in this course, creating the class-voted best idea of the
week a few times while working on my portfolio. Since I was without a partner for most of the end of year project time, I worked hard to generate and complete
my own ideas.

	<h2>Work Experience</h2>

	<p2>Internship at Contagion</p2><br>
	<p3>January - April 2014</p3><br>
	<p>I helped out with campaigns for clients including No1 Shoes,
the Comedy Festival, and AA. The campaign I worked on the most was
for the AA - a Facebook app where users could vote for their favourite beach.
Along with my partner, I designed and wrote most of the content for it,
including all the Facebook ads to gather an audience. The campaign was quite popular, generating over 60,000 votes, and was featured on TV3 News. link here<br><br>

	<!-- <strong>What I Learnt</strong><br><br>
	<p> I learnt a lot about working in a real commercial environment, 
		and how projects happen from start to finish, as well as developing my ideation skills. A key idea I took away from here was how to simplify ideas and processes so the message is clear and concise. The highlight for me was seeing all the different elements that go into making an app, and watching the analytics of user interactions. -->
<br><br>
<br><br>

<p2>Internship at MediaWorks</p2><br>
	<p3>November 2014 - June 2015</p3><br>
	<p>
		During my internship I really grew my web development skills. I worked a lot with jQuery and Javascript to create interactive campaigns for a variety of clients. I learnt from my manager at the time to always make my work the best it could be - he had a phrase; 'there bad design, good design, and wow.'. I also gained experience working together with different teams.

<br><br>
<br><br>

<p2>Creative Producer at MediaWorks</p2><br>
	<p3>June 2015 - Present</p3><br>
	<p>This role is similar to my internship, but over time I gained more responsibility, for example creating demos of all the ads types for the company website. I started working with Google Web Designer, and grew to work on bigger projects such as website redesigns.
